- mono repository :
	- all different code should be be present in a single github repo and not multiple github repo.
	- everything is in a single folder, holds frontend , backend and devops also
	- apps/ , packages/ :
		- apps/ contains the backend and and configs
		- packages/ have ui and common utiltiies 
		- can also have infra , deploy for infra and deploy stats for the repos.
	-  apps and packages are top-level applications and are present according to conventions.
	- most of the time present, dont need to setup 
- why monorepos  ?
	- why not simple folders ?
		- why cant directly store services in various top-level folders ?
		- should actually :
			- services are highly decoupled and dont share any code 
	- Some code will be like this ie shared code , monorepos are usually a better option to share code :

	- if some codesharing that needs to happen, monorepos are the best options.
	- shared code reuse
	- enhanced collaboration 
	- optimized builds and CI/CD : Turborepo offers smart caching to build optimized builds and uses executions strategies to reduce builds and build times.
	- shared eslint config: same code conventions and same linter for all of the projects in a single place.
	- centralized tooling and configuration : managing build tools, formatters and other configurations.
- Common monorepo frameworks in Node:
	- lerna -> og monorepo framework.
	- nx -> similar stuff , strictly monorepo framework
	- turborepo -> not exactly monorepo framework, under the hood let us choose whether to use npm workspaces, yarn workspaces and give something on top of it.
	- npm/yarn workspaces -> built it to the package manager 
	- probably use turborepo, as use monorepos on steroids.
	- one of vercel's best acquisitions.
- Build System vs Build System Orchestrator vs Monorepo Framework:
	- Build System:
		- tsc is a build system, gen js code from ts
		- vite for react projects
		- transforming source code written by developers to binary 
		- make , cmake , cargo etc.
		- also transforms the resultant code/binary into a minified versions, removing the debug symbols.
	- Monorepo Framework:
		- provides tools and conventions for managing projects that contain multiple packages or applications for shared code and for also defining the workspaces.
	- Turborepo is special:
		- It is a build system orchestrator 
		- how it provide top of these things like nx, lerna etc.
		- doesn't directly perform transpilation , but rather define task in its configuations that provides other tools that perform these transformations and changes .

		- it lets us schedule these builds in a certain way and lets us build these in a parallel way.
		- Dependency management during builds
		- caching during builds.
