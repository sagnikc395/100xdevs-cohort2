- state management in the backend 
- standard ways to do state management in the frontend and in the backend 
- how to maintain state in js process
- decentish way to store state and is not useful 
- useful for state management to do better state management on the backend.
- index.ts(new event done sent to stores) -> stores.ts (export games states) <- logger.ts(logs the state and real time updates) 
- where and how to store the data in our backend ?
	- game like data :
		- chess data 
		- coordinates 
	- or just a variable and shove there
- using singleton pattern 
- can also use redux on the backend for state mangement
- implement pub subs + singleton pattern 
	- common pattern used in many places.
- usually we use a stateless varibales
	- dont keep things on the frontned and shove them to backend 
	- to maintain consistency 
	- all web2 crud apps are stateless and are very easy to scale
- stateful server 
	- need to connected to same server stored in memory
	- stickiness 
	- hard to scale 
	- user is changing location very frequently.
	- everything stored in varibales.
	- not stored in database.
	- in ts
- every company will strive towards statelessness.
- applications like
	- realtime apps 
	- chess 
	- exhanges 
	- etc. need to have some amount of state associated with them.

- using a class to abstract away operations logic and make it more abstract for end user.
- using a class like GameManager
- singleton pattern-> anythign you want init only once and not only allow people to create new instance.
- singleton and strategy are mostly used and others are rarely used in js
	- make the constructor private
	- can;t be made from outside the class, but we can make from inside the class using the static variables.
	- these attributes are associated with the class and not with the objects for static variables.
